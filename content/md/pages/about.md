## Philipp Körner

I was a researcher and lecturer at HHU Düsseldorf until September 2025
in the group for software engineering and programming languages.

In almost 15 years with the group,
I learnt object-oriented programming in Java,
took a dive into C,
tinkered quite a lot in Prolog,
learned very much about Python
and ended up loving Clojure.

I am still very interested in formal methods,
compiler constructions and
program mostly in Clojure if I get the choice.

You can find a collection of my publications on this page,
as well as some views on teaching.
Interesting content might follow some day.
